Flash Cards:
When we use the cat command with a file that has lots of lines, the entire screen will be flooded with lines and we will be able to read only the last portion of the file. In such a case, we can use the less command to read the file contents one page at a time.  For example, to open a large file spells.txt, type less spells.txt on the command line. 

 

Now, we can move up & down in the file and exit less by pressing q. With the less command, there are no lines displayed on the screen, and our terminal remains clean and pristine.

There is also more command which was used in the 90s, but the less command has more friendly features.
